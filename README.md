## Design Process
This website is for userswho which to travel, by car, to gather more information before they make their move.<br />
User Stories:
- As a driver who wish to go to a place, I want to know more about the more information about the location and the trip, so that I can make a more wise decision, of to go or not to go.

I had also made changes to my final project, compared to the wireframe version, so to make it more suit the target users.
